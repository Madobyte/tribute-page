                Dolores, Felipa, Margarita, Ursula, Nellie, Vicenta, Suzanne, Consuelo, Osei-san, 
                and Seiko. These are just some of the women who fell for the charm, wit, and good looks of 
                Jose Rizal. They were not exactly Rizal’s girlfriends, but more of flings and minor attractions.
            </p>

            <p>
                While many people are familiar with the love story of Rizal and Josephine Bracken—his last 
                lover before he died—it is also noteworthy mentioning Leonor Rivera, Rizal’s most significant love 
                and hearthbreak. They had been engaged for 10 years, a time when Rizal spent much of his life in 
                Europe, leaving Rivera in the Philippines.
            </p>

            <p>
                But what did Rizal do in Europe during those 10 years when he was engaged to Rivera?
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, he was two-timing two Leonors: Leonor Rivera and Leonor Valenzuela. While Rizal was 
                away in Europe, he tasked his wingman and namesake Jose M. Cecilio to spy on his two love 
                interests in the Philippines.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 1884, when Rizal was already engaged to Rivera, Cecilio discovered that another man 
                wanted to propose to Rivera. To dissuade the man, Cecilio introduced him to Leonor 
                Valenzuela, only to find out that she, too, was engaged to Rizal!
